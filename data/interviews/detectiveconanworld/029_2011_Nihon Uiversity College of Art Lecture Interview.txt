I can give a source - and it's from 2chan( https://www.logsoku.com/r/2ch.net/ymag/1307192217/ ), essentially. ^^; This is my original post( https://www.detectiveconanworld.com/forum/topic/523-boss-of-the-black-organization/page-30#entry111958 ) - and as I mentioned in that post, it's up to you to believe this spoiler or not. I can translate the entire post where I got that spoiler from, if you'd like:

The spoilers from a talk show Gosho reportedly did yesterday at a university is crazy
Like, you're gonna spoil that much?
It was crazier than [the interview in] OtonaFami
(Note: すごい can mean 'great, terrific, horrible', etc, but for this context I chose 'crazy')
(446-450 pretty much ask 445 to spill the details, then)

もったいぶるバカはほおっておけよ

博士は黒幕ではない
確定

Ignore the idiot putting on airs
I'll give the spoilers instead
Professor [Agasa] isn't BO boss (Note: 黒幕 literally means 'black curtain' or 'political fixer', but I'm pretty sure it means BO boss here)
Settled

今後の展開において28巻を読み直しておくと
おーとなるというレポがあった

There was a 'Whoa!'-inducing report that said
On future developments, [Gosho said that he'll] re-read Volume 28

とりあえず検索して出てきた物
来場者との質疑応答があって
博士は黒組織のボス？って質問があって
「阿笠博士は黒の組織のボスじゃありません」って答える
バーローは何故バーローなの？
タッチかなんかあだち充作品の主人公がバーローって言ってたから
世良真純の人気が凄いと講演会で話す
あの花（あの日見た花の名前を僕達はまだ知らない。）を楽しみに見ていた
最終回も見て楽しんでから講演会に来た
花咲くいろはも楽しみに見てるよ

Anyways, here's what [I found] through searching
There was a Q&A session with the attendants,
and [Gosho] answered, "Professor Agasa isn't the BO boss"
Why 'バーロー (bah-loh)'? (Note: You usually say 'baka', but Gosho likes to say 'bah-loh')
Because Touch and other works by Adachi Mitsuru said 'bah-loh'
Talks about how popular Sera Masumi is during lecture
Was enjoying あの日見た花の名前を僕達はまだ知らない。( https://www.anohana.jp/ )  (We still don't know the name of the flower we saw that day)
Enjoyed the last episode then came to lecture
[He] looks forward to watching 花咲くいろは ( https://www.hanasakuiroha.jp/ ) (Blossoming Iroha) ( https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iroha )
Hmm, you're right, I need better sources - *googles, since apparently that's what the 2chan guy did to get all this info*
It seems true that Gosho really did give a lecture at his former university (Nihon University College of Art) (Original link redirects to homepage: http://www.art.nihon-u.ac.jp/ ), according to the university's website. This page talks about the Nichigei Award for Excellence, which Gosho apparently received this year - the website mentions that the award ceremony was moved from March 11th to April 8th due to the 2011 Tohoku earthquake and tsunami, so the ceremony happened this year. This website also mentions that the university plans on having the two winners (one of whom is Gosho) give a lecture later. (授賞式は、3月11日の東日本大震災から間もない4月8日、芸術学部新入生歓迎式プログラムとして江古田キャンパスの大ホールで行われ、ご出席いただいた林真理子氏からは、壇上から受賞の喜びとともに励ましの言葉が述べられました。また、仕事の都合で残念ながら欠席された青山剛昌氏は、ビデオで心あたたまるメッセージを届けてくださいました。お二人には後日、学内で講演を行っていただく予定です。)
Then this fan website ( https://www.koware.net/cgi/conan_jyouhou/scheduler.cgi?mode=view&no=796 ) says that the lecture commemorating the Nichigei Award for Excellence is held on June 24th 2011 from 2pm at Nihon University College of Art Ekoda Hall. Apparently only university students could attend. (学部所属の学生さんのみ参加可能 ... 2011/06/24の14時から、日本大学芸術学部の江古田大ホールで日藝賞記念講演会として、青山先生の講演が行われます。)
One more evidence for the lecture! The university's blog (Original link redirects to 404: http://blog.ocn.ne.jp/close.html ) mentions that Gosho's lecture is on June 24th 2011. Here's the poster from that blog:

Okay, the fact that the lecture happened on June 24th 2011 at Gosho's alma mater seems legit . . . BRB googling more.
EDIT: Also, you have to admit that, while 2chan may not be 100% accurate, they do turn out to be mostly right most of the times. ^^; I mean, I learned about OtonaFami from there, and I always go to the 2chan Shonen Sunday Spoilers board to check for the latest spoilers on the latest Conan file, which has turned out to be pretty accurate so far. I'm also impressed that the lecture turned out to be true, as well.
EDIT2: Found one evidence for claim that "Gosho said Agasa isn't BO boss" via Twitter! This 青木敬士 (Aoki Keishi) person is, according to his profile, the Associate Professor at Nihon University of Art, Literary Arts(Creative Writing), and apparently organized the lecture that Gosho gave on June 24th (this tweet says that, since he is organizing the lecture, his classes are cancelled for those days) ( https://twitter.com/AOKI_KC/status/84051732849639426 ). He also lent his pen to Aoyama when Aoyama was signing signatures, and he got excited and jokingly tweeted that maybe he should take care not to wipe off Gosho's fingerprints (lol). ( https://twitter.com/AOKI_KC/status/84173256361394176 )
This tweet ( https://twitter.com/AOKI_KC/status/84179949887569920 ) is the main evidence:
青山剛昌先生、講演会の質疑応答で「阿笠博士は黒の組織のボスじゃありません」って明言しちゃってたけど(汗) ……もしかしたら叙述トリックかもしれないよ(笑)
Aoyama Gosho-sensei declared definitively during the lecture's Q&A that "Professor Agasa isn't the Black Organization's boss," ha ha *sweats* . . . maybe this is a narrative trick? (laughs)
This tweet ( https://twitter.com/AOKI_KC/status/84175955802865664 ) corroborates with what the 2chan board said about Gosho's favorite shows - maybe this is that one 2chan guy's source? I dunno.
講演会来場者との質疑応答のなかにあったんですが、青山剛昌先生も「あの花」の最終回は楽しみにして観ていらしたそうですよ！ あと「花咲くいろは」も
This was included in the Q&A with the attendants - reportedly, Aoyama Gosho-sensi also enjoyed watching "Anohana"'s last episode! "Blossoming Iroha", too

Oh! I found Nihon University's profile on Aoki Keishi. ( http://kenkyu-web.cin.nihon-u.ac.jp/Profiles/37/0003669/profile.html )
