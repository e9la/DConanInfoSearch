A: I am amazed too! (laughs)
Q: Have you ever visited Nagasaki? It's such an impressive place.
A: I once went to Huis Ten Bosch* during a company outing with Aoyama Prod.
(T/N *looks like a Nagasaki district, famous for themed parks)
Q: This summer, in addition to the Forensic Division Exhibition, there will be events and talk shows with Conan's voice actors. Finally, please tell something brief [a few words] to Nagasaki people.
A: Speaking about Nagasaki, for the main theme song of "Zero the Enforcer" I am much obliged to Masaharu Fukuyama! I really enjoyed Huis Ten Bosch, and I would like to go there again. I wanna try authentic Nagasaki Vegetable Salad! (laughs)
[T/N. He refers to Chanpon, which apparently is a sort of vegetable salad typical of Nagasaki]
