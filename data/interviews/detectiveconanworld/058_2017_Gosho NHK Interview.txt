Aoyama's latest interview for NHK: he talks over his interest in the Sherlock Holmes' series and how he got inspiration from Conan Doyle's works to create his own characters. Guess what character was based off Moriarty?Â ;)

Gosho Aoyama first found out about Conan Doyle in elementary school, through the book "The Dancing Men".It seems he became obsessed over the code during that time."It scared me but at the same time, the curiosity rose""If I hadn't seen this, I probably wouldn't have written Conan"In his elementary school essay, he wrote that he wanted to be a manga writer before but now (as in that time) he wants to be a detective. But he doesn't have good physicality so he'll put both dreams together and write a manga about detectives. ðŸ•µAs you may already know, the town Beika is a spin-off of Baker and that Beika's "Bei" is the letter that also means rice. And that letter is similar to the Union Jack ðŸ‡¬ðŸ‡§Continuing on, they asked Gosho to name his top 3 characters in Holmes.He put James Moriarty as #3He said Moriarty is the ideal character for the Black Organization boss. Just like Moriarty, the boss doesn't show their face and works behind the scenes, only pulling the strings on the crimes from far awayGosho says "I try to make it so that they (the boss) is cold-blooded, won't leave a single scrap of evidence, and almost invisible"He put Mycroft Holmes in #2Gosho says that he's smarter than Sherlock Holmes, the protagonist, which is also the same situation with Yusaku Kudo, Shinichi's fatherAnd lastly, he put Irene Adler as #1. Apparently, Haibara Ai's "Ai" is taken from Irene Adler's "I" which is similarly pronounced
