That black Gundam -like robot is a present from Shogakukan to Aoyama to celebrate the 200 million sales and there's only 1 in the world
Confirms again that in the beginnings, he didn't expect the manga to last more than 3 months or so
And what was said in other interviews: a rule he always keeps is that Conan never cries
Also, he himself dunno why the series remains popular
And to make cases simplers he doesn't make cases with accomplices
And like it was said in the preview, he's decided on the outcome / result / end
Tricks are planned with a couple of the editors in charge and can take up to 12 hours of discussion to settle on them
These meetings are once per month
Editors bring stuff that's a current trend or that could be used for tricks
Then they try to recreate the case of Sato and the wedding ring
So insofar nothing that we didn't already know
Most was talking with the anime / movie producer about the 3 keys to the boom of the movies
(Guest VAs, collaborations (Lupin III & Conan) and Amuro)
And yes, he admits that movie 11 was a flop and that made them rethink
